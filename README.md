# CMP-4008Y-2023

I will add the code that we write during the live lectures on this module here. At the moment there are two directories - one for week 1, and the other for week 2. 

As a reminder, in week 1 we started the implementation of a simple Film class. I didn't have time to finish this in the live lecture so finished it afterwards and uploaded the changes here. 

In week 2, we started this example from scratch and went through the Film class again - hence, the Film class in week 1 and week 2 will be very similar. I've also uploaded the .csv data within the week 2 directory and we will carry on with this film example in week 3 and beyond, extending the code that we wrote in week 2.

Further, please see the week 2 folder for the .drawio file for the UML class diagram that we made during the live lecture. If you'd like to load up/edit this example yourself, first make a local copy of the .drawio file on your computer somewhere. Then go to \url{app.diagrams.net} and click File -> Open from -> Device. From there you can select the diagram file that you download and you should then be able to edit it as you see fit.
